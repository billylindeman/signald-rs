# signald-rs

Rust library for interacting with [signald](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald). signald-rs is fully async, and supports both [async-std](https://async.rs/) and [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) runtimes (defaults to async-std). The bulk of the library is autogenerated by `build.rs` (all autogenerated code is in `src/actions.rs` and `src/types.rs`). To make the autogeneration easier, all struct members in the types are `Option<T>`, so parameters that are `None` can be easily skipped during serialization. This does make the types a bit cumbersome to deal with at times, so I'm considering better solutions.
